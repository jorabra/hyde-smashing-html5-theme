Smashing HTML5! theme for Hyde
##############################

The "Smashing HTML5!" theme was originally made by Enrique Ram√≠rez (Smashing
Magazine) back in 2009. It's a nice looking theme, so I ported it to be used
as a Hyde theme.


Usage
-----

1. Have `Hyde <https://github.com/hyde/hyde>`_ installed on your system.
2. Download the "Smashing HTML5!" theme `here
   <https://github.com/jorabra/hyde-smashing-html5-theme/zipball/master>`_.
3. Exctract the ZIP file.
4. If you're not familiar with Hyde, please read the documentation on how to
   modify and add pages. (Unfortunately, the Hyde documentation isn't all that
   good at the current time.)
5. *hyde -s <hyde_content_dir> gen -r -d  <hyde_output_dir>*
